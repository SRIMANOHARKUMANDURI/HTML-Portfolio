<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>As an adolescent, technology and technical gadgets adorned my world and filled it with passion to know more about this ever-evolving domain. Watching the movie “The Imitation Game” as a young adult shaped me as a tech enthusiast and propelled it in the right direction, making me realize that my career lies in my passion. As Alan Turing built the Turing Machine to crack the German Enigma code during World War II, I also aspire to pioneer in this field and invent innovative ideas and technologies that have the power and potential to change the world we belong to. Hence, I decided to pursue a Master’s degree in Computer Science to build upon the foundation I have in this domain and better position myself in this industry to solve real-life problems.

<p>After completing my Intermediate in 2019, I joined the SRM Institute Of Science & Technology to pursue a Bachelor’s degree in Computer Science Engineering. The program provided me with a thorough understanding of several subjects including Computer Networks, Database Management, Network Security and Cybersecurity which ultimately helped in building a strong foundation in this realm. As part of my academic curriculum, I have undertaken several projects such as “Text Classification into Emotional States”, “EDA and Data Mining on Yelp Restaurant Review” and “QTrip”. In the first project, I used the Deep Learning-based BERT Technique to identify and classify various emotional states within a given text. In the second project, I applied Data Mining Techniques to provide personalized recommendations and marketing strategies to ensure customer satisfaction. My team also published a research paper on this project in IJISRT and further presented this paper at a conference called ICREAT-2023. In the third project, I designed and developed a travel website on Netlify using HTML and CSS based on Wireframe layout to provide information on diverse adventures in various cities. Through these projects, I honed my skills in Natural Language Processing, Machine Learning, Exploratory Data Analysis, Data Visualization, UX Design and Testing and Debugging. I completed my undergraduate studies in 2023 with a CGPA of 9.08.</p>
<p>Keen on supplementing my classroom learning, I pursued several courses such as Machine Learning & Big Data using Python, Data Science with R Language, Full Stack Development in Web Development, Comptia Security+ syo-601, Linux Operations, Database Structures for Java and JavaScript for Web Development. Pursuing these courses sharpened my skills in the Fundamentals of Machine Learning Algorithms, Python Libraries, Data Visualization, Predictive Modelling, UI/UX Design Principles, Network Attacks and Vulnerabilities, MongoDB, Express, React, and Node JS. Furthermore, I have attended workshops on Machine Learning and IBM Watson by Smart Bridge in collaboration with IBM and Ethical Hacking organized by Azure Skynet Solutions Pvt. Ltd. where I garnered a deeper understanding of AI Services, Data Preprocessing, Model Deployment, Cybersecurity Fundamentals, Penetration Testing and Network Security. Transcending the boundaries of the classroom, I enhanced my leadership and organization skills by being the Vice President and Treasurer of our College Technical Club named ‘Andropedia’. Additionally, I was also the Vice President and Treasurer for the Telugu Association Club at our College enhancing my management and organization skills further. Furthermore, I have also participated in various debate competitions honing my skills in Public Speaking, Critical Thinking, Civic Engagement and Rhetorical Skills</p>
<p>My Father has played a pivotal role in shaping the human and technological proficiency in me. Being a tech enthusiast himself, he keeps himself up-to-date regarding the latest advancements within the tech industry and also ensures that I follow the updates as well. My cousin who works as a Data Engineer has been another source of inspiration for me to dive into this domain witnessing the satisfaction he gets in following his passion. Hence equipped with an enriched set of skills, I now aspire to complete my Master’s degree in Computer Science and become a Cybersecurity Consultant or Software Engineer at renowned companies like TCS, Infosys or Wipro. Down the line, I aim to become a Senior Security Consultant or Chief Architect at established organizations like Amazon or Microsoft.</p>
